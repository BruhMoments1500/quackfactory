### On Rubber Duck Debugging
Rubber Duck Debugging is a problem solving exercise whereby the individual explains the issue at hand, in simple terms, *line by line* -- to a rubber duck. In the interest of silo busting and the promotion of networking, we've revised this time-honored exercise to include an additional human participant.

### Ducking for Two
Replacing the rubber duck with a human participant presents us with multiple opportunities not present in the original:
- exposes less-informed organization members to technical challenges facing the team.
- reinforces listening skills for the members playing the duck role.
- reinforces speaking and code comprehension skills for the debugging members.
- provides an opportunity for actual feedback after the debugging session.

During opt-in events, users may indicate their willingness to participate as rubber ducks. Throughout the event, any other member may choose to play the role of Debugger. When called upon by a debugging member, a rubber duck shall enter a voice conversation with them. During this time, the participants may agree on a time limit for the session. For the duration of this session, the member playing the role of the rubber duck is discouraged from responding with anything other than a quack. At the end of the session, the debugging member is encouraged to hear feedback the rubber duck may have.

During opt-out events, the mechanisms for opt-in events still exist, but a number of rubber ducks and debuggers are chosen from the membership throughout the event. Members chosen as debuggers are furnished with a generalized code snippet to explain, line-by-line, if they do not have an issue of their own to present to the rubber duck.
